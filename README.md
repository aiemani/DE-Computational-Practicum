# Computational practicum

**Differential Equations, FALL2020 course, Innopolis University**.

## Objectives

Implement three numerical methods: 

1. Euler's method
2. Improved Euler's method
3. Runge-Kutta method (with 4 stages) 

, and apply them to the a given differential equation.

Compare the results with analytical solution. Provide a gui that will plot approximations and truncation errors. Also, gui should allow user to change initial conditions.
